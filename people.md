[Department of Computer and Information Sciences](http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk)
at the University of Strathclyde and comprises

[Prof. Neil Ghani](http://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/ghanineilprof/)

:  who is currently working on theories of advanced data types,
   containers, induction recursion, parametricity and all areas of
   category theory. See
   [Neil's current homepage](http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~ng/)
   for more details or email [neil.ghani [at]
   strath.ac.uk](mailto:neil.ghani [at] strath.ac.uk). And,
