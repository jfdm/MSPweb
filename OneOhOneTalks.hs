It now seems like it is  possible to give a variation of this encoding for which the  induction principle is derivable after all. The trick is to use  identity types to cut down the transformations of type  (Pi X : Set) . (F(X) -> X) -> X to the ones that are internally strongly dinatural, making use of a formula for a \"generalised Yoneda Lemma\" by Uustalu and Vene.",

  abstract   = "Ohad gave an informal overview of his current draft, with the following abstract:\n\nHaskell incorporates computational effects modularly using sequences of monad transformers, termed monad stacks. The current practice is to find the appropriate stack for a given task using intractable brute force and heuristics. By restricting attention to algebraic stack combinations, we provide a linear-time algorithm for generating all the appropriate monad stacks, or decide no such stacks exist. Our approach is based on Hyland, Plotkin, and Power's algebraic analysis of monad transformers, who propose a graph-theoretical solution to this problem. We extend their analysis with a straightforward connection to the modular decomposition of a graph and to cographs, a.k.a. series-parallel graphs.\n\nWe present an accessible and self-contained account of this monad-stack generation problem, and, more generally, of the decomposition of a combined algebraic theory into sums and tensors, and its algorithmic solution. We provide a web-tool implementing this algorithm intended for semantic investigations of effect combinations and for monad stack generation.",

In 1990, Griffin idly wondered what would happen if one did the same in a typed lambda calculus.  The answer came out: the inhabited types become the theorems of classical logic.\n\n I will present the lambda mu-calculus, one of the cleanest attempts to add control operators to a type theory.  We'll cover the good news: the inhabited types are the tautologies of minimal classical logic, and Godel's Double Negation translation from classical to intuitionistic logic turns into the CPS translation.\n\nAnd the bad news: control operators don't play well with other types. Add natural numbers (or some other inductive type), and you get inconsistency. Add Sigma-types, and you get degeneracy (any two objects of the same type are definitionally equal).  It gets worse: add plus-types, and you break Subject Reduction.",
